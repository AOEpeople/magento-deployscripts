Magento Deployment Scripts
==========================

Author: Fabrizio Branca

This is a collection of scripts used to build/package, deploy and install Magento projects.

*Import note:*
Never use the master branch in your build jobs. Instead clone a specific tag:
```
git clone -b v1.0.0 https://github.com/AOEpeople/magento-deployscripts.git
```
Since these scripts might change significantly and your deployment process might fail otherwise.
